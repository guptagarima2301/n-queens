# N-Queens Visualiser

The N-Queens puzzle involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other, meaning no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

A common approach to solving this problem is using a recursive backtracking algorithm, which places queens one by one in different columns, checking for conflicts, and backtracks when a conflict is detected.

## Features

### Visualization of the Algorithm: 
Step-by-step visual representation of how the algorithm places each queen and backtracks when necessary.
### Customizable Board Size: 
Users can input the value of N to see how the algorithm works on different board sizes.
### Interactive UI:
A user-friendly interface that allows users to start, pause, and reset the visualization.
### Performance Metrics: 
Shows the number of iterations and backtracks in real-time
