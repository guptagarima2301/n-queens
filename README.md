The N-Queens puzzle involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other, meaning no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

A common approach to solving this problem is using a recursive backtracking algorithm, which places queens one by one in different columns, checking for conflicts, and backtracks when a conflict is detected.
